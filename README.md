# Telco User Churn project
The goal of this project is to identify the causes of user churn and propose a possible solution to reducing it. 

# Note  
telco_manipulation.py and importdb.sql is the starting method that pulls the data from a sql database. 

churn_manipulation.py and churn_workbook.ipynb import telco data from a .csv file modified in an excel program. As of 2021-04-29, churn_* is the current project.
